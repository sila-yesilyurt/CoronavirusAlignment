//It returns five things: first, a maximum score local alignment of the strings corresponding to these penalties.
//If should also return four integers start0, end0, start1, and end1, such that the
//alignment is of [start0: end0] and [start1: end1] in the respective strings.
//(That is, the strings don't include the symbols at positions end0 or end1, respectively.)
